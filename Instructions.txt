Dog Genomics
Accomplished:
1. Genotype Counts (inbreeding)- homozygous vs heterozygous across whole file
2. Genotype Counts per chromosome based on input- input chromosome number and get count
3.
(3a) Genotype Counts per chromosome total- per chromosome homozygous vs heterozygous
(3b) input each indivual genotype TAG
(3c) input file with predifined genotype list

To Accomplish in the Future
4. Codon-Bias-genome: count how many A's, C's, G's, T's in whole genome
5. Codon-Bias-chromosome count how many A's, C's, G's, T's in each chromosome
(6.) Report how many A=A's, C=C's, G=G's, T=T's for entire genome
